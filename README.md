Hi, I'm @Philmattt04. I'm currently learning SQL database. I started learing it a week ago and I've already learned how to create tables, store data onto tables,
and create queries. I learned all of these new skills from https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql. I am looking forward to learning even more on SQL!
